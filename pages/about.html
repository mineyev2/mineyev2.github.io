                </p>
                <p class="card-text">
                    My name is Roman, currently a Junior undergraduate at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">
                    My first introduction to music was when my parents enrolled me for piano practice. However, relatable to many other kids, after a couple years I quit.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">
                    My excitement for music sparked back during my sophomore year of highschool. I picked up the piano again after watching Kyle Landry's rendition of Howl's Moving Castle on YouTube (If you haven't seen it you definitely should check it out!).
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">
                    Ever since then music has always been something I truly identify with, and I hope that all of you that find this website enjoy the beats and melodies that I have produced!
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">
                    Thanks :)
                </p>
